\chapter{Introduction\label{cha:chapter1}}

Machine learning models are notoriously memory and compute intensive, 
making the need to reduce their resource usage ever more pressing.
\\
\\
Context (1 paragraph):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item redundancy + memory expensive
        \item but we need more for less
        \item there are various techniques, including learned quantization
        \item \{need statement on why learned quantization is of interest here\}
    \end{enumerate}

    


Problems that are to be solved in this thesis (2 paragraphs):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item optimal quantization - how to reach it
        \item how it's impossible to compute gradients for floor operations
    \end{enumerate}
Existing work and introduction to the idea on how to solve the above problems (1 paragraph):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item optimal quantization - how to reach it
        \item how it's impossible to compute gradients for floor operations
    \end{enumerate}
Our contributions (1 paragraph):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \{Literally a list of contributions \}
        \item Outline the thesis as a list of bullet points containing a short introduction into chapters.
    \end{enumerate}
